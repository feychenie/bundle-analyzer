The token is required to setup plugin.

## How do I add new users to my repository?

Bundle Analyzer uses GitHub/ API's to authorize users. No setup is necessary. As long as a user has read access to your project, they can view bundle analyze.

If you don't see the repository, try to logout and login, it should appear.

## How can I add a repository?
