# Setup with CLI

Bundle Analyzer is available as a CLI tool. You will get your stats uploaded in one command.

## Usage

First install the CLI tool in your project:

```bash
npm install @bundle-analyzer/cli
```

Then run the following command in your CI:

```bash
webpack --mode production --json | bundle-analyzer --token <your-repository-token>
```

If you already have stats, you can use `cat` to pipe them:

```bash
cat webpack-stats.json | bundle-analyzer --token <your-repository-token>
```
