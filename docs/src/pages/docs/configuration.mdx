# Configuration

Configuration can be done directly in your project settings or using a project configuration file (recommended).

## Configuration File

A configuration file permits to adjust check in a specific PR or commit, it is more flexible and recommended.

The configuration file has to be in the root of your project, several configuration files are supported:

- A `bundle-analyzer.config.js` file that exports an object (recommended).
- A `.bundle-analyzerrc` file, written in YAML or JSON, with optional extensions: .yaml/.yml/.json/.js.
- A "bundle-analyzer" key in your package.json file.

The configuration file will be resolved from the directory you run the command to upload stats.

## Example

**JSON:**

```json
{
  "files": [
    {
      "test": "*",
      "maxSize": "250 kB"
    }
  ]
}
```

**JS:**

```js
// .bundle-analyzer.config.js
module.exports = {
  files: [
    {
      test: '*',
      maxSize: '250 kB',
    },
  ],
}
```

**YAML:**
