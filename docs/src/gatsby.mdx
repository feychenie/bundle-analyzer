# Setup with Gatsby

Bundle Analyzer can easily be set up with Gatsby using an official plugin.

## Usage

To enable Bundle Analyzer in your Gatsby project, install `@bundle-analyzer/gatsby-plugin` and add it to your `gatsby-config.js`:

```js
plugins: [
  {
    resolve: '@bundle-analyzer/gatsby-plugin',
    options: { token: '<repository-token>' },
  },
]
```

At the next deploy, your bundle will be automatically analyzed!
